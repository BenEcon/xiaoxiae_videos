INTRODUCTION
---

- definition
- maximal, perfect pairing
- free vertex, free alternating path
	- is maximal => doesn't have it (if it had, it wouldn't be maximal)
	- doesn't have it => is maximal (a little harder)

---
TREE PERFECT PAIRING
---

- attempt to pair each free vertex by dfs
- visualize algorithm runtime

---
BIPARTITE GRAPH PERFECT PAIRING
---

- add cycles of even length to trees
- show that it doesn't break anything

---
GENERAL GRAPH PAIRING
---

- cycles of odd length suck -- show problem
- introduce blossom
- show that compressing it, finishing pairing and uncompressing it doesn't break anything
- visualize algorithm runtime
