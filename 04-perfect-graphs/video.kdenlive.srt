00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:10,649
Perfect graphs are a family of graphs with various interesting properties, notably that many problems that are NP complete on general graphs can be solved efficiently on perfect graphs.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There exist various characterizations of perfect graphs.

3
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:21,749
The one that we’ll be focusing on in this video is the Weak perfect graph theorem, proved in 1972 by László Lovász.

4
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:29,116
Before proceeding to the proof, there are quite a few definitions that we have to know in order to understand it.

5
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:33,166
You might already know some of them, so feel free to skip forward in the video accordingly.

6
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:45,899
A complement of a graph G is a graph Ḡ, such that each two vertices are adjacent in Ḡ, if and only if they are not adjacent in G.

7
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,200
A clique is a subgraph of a graph, such that each two vertices are adjacent.

8
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:07,316
Analogically, an independent set in a graph is a set of vertices such that no two are adjacent.

9
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:15,550
We’ll also denote ω(G) to be the size of the largest clique in G (also called the clique number),

10
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:21,050
and α(G) to be the size of the largest independent set in G (also called the independence number).

11
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,250
These two concepts are closely tied together.

12
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,950
Considering a complement of a graph, we see that each independent set becomes a clique, and vice versa.

13
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:44,499
A graph H is an induced subgraph of the graph G, if and only if we can get H by removing zero or more vertices (along with their edges) from G.

14
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,300
Additionally, it is a proper induced subgraph, if we remove one or more vertices.

15
00:01:56,066 --> 00:02:06,449
The chromatic number χ(G) of a graph G is the minimum number of colors we need to color the graph’s vertices, such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

16
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:20,083
Finally, a graph G is perfect (informally denoted G⋆), if and only if ∀H ≤ G : χ(H) = ω(H).

17
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:31,700
With the definitions out of the way, let’s make a few observations about how perfect graphs behave, that will help us understand the proof better.

18
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:43,250
Firstly, ∀H ≤ G : ω(H) ≤ χ(H), because each maximum clique has to contain as many colors as its vertices.

19
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:47,316
For perfect graphs, this becomes an equality from definition.

20
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,299
Secondly, if a graph is perfect, then each of its induced subgraphs is perfect too.

21
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,200
This again follows immediately from the definition of a perfect graph, since something is true for each of its induced subgraphs.

22
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:08,733
As for examples, some common families of graphs that are perfect include complete graphs (where χ and ω is the number of vertices)

23
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:15,183
and bipartite graphs (where χ is either 1 when it has no edges, or 2 if it does, either of which works).

24
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:27,600
Some families that are not perfect include cycles of odd length ≥ 5 (because ω = 2 and χ = 3) and even wheel graphs of length ≥ 6 (because ω = 3 and χ = 4).

25
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:32,750
Our first lemma is actually a characterization of a perfect graph.

26
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:44,666
It states that the graph G is perfect, if and only if ∀H ≤ G contains an independent set, such that each maximum clique in H contains a vertex from this set (called a vast independent set).

27
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:50,233
The left-to-right implication is pretty straight-forward.

28
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:56,483
Since χ(G) = ω(G), each largest clique contains all possible colors.

29
00:03:56,483 --> 00:04:01,850
That means we can choose any color and let the independent set be all vertices of that color.

30
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,516
By definition, such independent set is vast.

31
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,600
The right-to-left implication can be proven using induction on the number of vertices.

32
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,650
The base case is trivially true.

33
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,450
For the induction step, assume that we’ve proven the statement for all smaller graphs.

34
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:23,583
Let G be a graph such that each induced subgraph of G contains a vast independent set.

35
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:30,367
Let I be a vast independent set in G, and H be the induced subgraph obtained from G by removing I.

36
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:39,550
Observe that ω(H) = ω(G) − 1, since all maximum cliques in G contain one vertex from I.

37
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:46,667
By induction, H is perfect, so there exists a vertex coloring of H using ω(G) − 1 colors.

38
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:54,099
Adding the vertices of I back, we can color all of them using one extra color and obtain a coloring of G using ω(G) colors.

39
00:04:55,983 --> 00:05:02,833
Our second lemma states that if G is perfect, then any graph constructed from G by expanding a vertex is also perfect.

40
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:13,133
By expanding, we mean that we replace the vertex with a complete graph of any size (denoted Kp) and connect it to all of its neighbours accordingly.

41
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,733
For proof, observe that expanding a vertex to Kp is equivalent to repeatedly expanding it to K2,

42
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:23,450
so it’s enough to prove that expanding a vertex to K2 preserves perfectness.

43
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:28,466
Let’s again use induction on the number of vertices in G.

44
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:32,282
The base case is expanding a single vertex to K2, which is perfect.

45
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:42,433
Now we have some graph G and a vertex v that we expand to v, v′, forming G′. We’ll examine two cases.

46
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:47,683
Case one is that expanding increases ω (obviously only by one).

47
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:52,933
This is fine, since we can now use an additional color on v′, so G′ is still perfect.

48
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:57,432
Case two is that expanding doesn’t increase ω.

49
00:05:57,433 --> 00:06:01,033
In this case, let’s take a χ coloring of G.

50
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:09,550
Looking at the set of vertices with the same color as v, we know that this must be a vast independent set (since each clique contains all of the colors).

51
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:15,017
However, v is not a part of a maximum clique, because otherwise ω would have increased.

52
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:24,800
Removing all vertices of this color besides v will decrease ω by one and, by induction, give a χ − 1 coloring of the smaller graph.

53
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,633
Adding the vertices back using the removed color, including the not-yet-added v′ proves the second case.

54
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:38,482
Now we’ll finally prove the main theorem. It states that a graph G is perfect, if and only if Ḡ is perfect.

55
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:46,483
First, notice that although this is an equivalence, we only need to prove one implication, since the statement is symmetrical.

56
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:53,733
We’ll prove the implication by contradiction. Let’s take the smallest graph G⋆ that is perfect but Ḡ isn’t.

57
00:06:53,733 --> 00:07:00,750
Because Ḡ isn’t perfect, it follows from lemma 1 that it has an induced subgraph H without a vast independent set.

58
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:14,982
Furthermore, it must be that H = Ḡ, because if H⋆ < Ḡ, then H̄ would be perfect (since H̄ < G⋆ and G⋆ is perfect).

59
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:19,467
This would, however, be a contradiction with the minimality of (G⋆,Ḡ).

60
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,317
We now know that Ḡ doesn’t have a vast independent set, meaning that each independent set misses at least one maximum clique.

61
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:32,766
Translated into the language of the graph G, each clique misses at least one maximum independent set.

62
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,050
Let’s list all of the cliques in G⋆, calling them Q1 to Qt.

63
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:44,783
From the previous observation, for each clique Ql, we have a maximum independent set Il, such that they are disjoint.

64
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,633
We’ll now do something that seems very strange, but is actually the core idea behind the proof.

65
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:56,333
For each vertex v in G⋆, let f(v) denote the number of the maximum independent sets that it’s in.

66
00:07:57,033 --> 00:08:02,417
By expanding each vertex v to size f(v), we create a new graph G′⋆.

67
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:09,732
Now we know that G′⋆ is perfect, because G⋆ is perfect and any graph expanded from G⋆ is, using lemma 2, also perfect.

68
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,800
The rest of the proof is basically rearranging inequalities in order to show that χ(G′⋆) ≠ ω(G′⋆),

69
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,100
which would make G′⋆ not perfect, leading to a contradiction.

70
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,699
Let’s count the number of vertices of G′⋆.

71
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:33,232
Since the maximum independent sets from G⋆ don’t overlap in G′⋆ (from the way we expanded each vertex), it’s equal to t ⋅ α(G⋆).

72
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:38,216
Using this, we’ll calculate the lower bound for χ(G′⋆).

73
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:46,166
It must be greater than |V(G′⋆)|/α(G′⋆), because that is the most efficient use of the colors

74
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,916
(each color is not only an independent set, but also the largest one).

75
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:59,366
α(G′⋆) is, however, just α(G⋆), because expanding a vertex can’t increase the size of the maximum independent set.

76
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:02,966
Plugging the value for vertices and simplifying gives us t.

77
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,417
We’ll now calculate the upper bound for ω(G′⋆).

78
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,649
Let Q′ be the largest clique in G′⋆.

79
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,983
This clique must have been created from inflating some clique Q in G⋆.

80
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:19,650
Recall that each clique in G misses at least one maximum independent set.

81
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:28,816
This means, that ω(G′⋆) ≤ t − 1, because there can be at most one vertex for each independent set, except the one that we know it misses.

82
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:35,566
Combining those two inequalities, we get that ω(G′⋆) < χ(G′⋆),

83
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:40,182
meaning that G′⋆ is not perfect, reaching a contradiction and proving the theorem.

84
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:47,166
A stronger version of the theorem that we just proved is the Strong perfect graph theorem.

85
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:54,532
It states that a graph is perfect, if and only if it doesn’t contain an odd hole or an odd antihole greater than 3.

86
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:59,400
By hole, we mean an induced cycle and by antihole, we mean a complement to an induced cycle.

87
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:07,649
These two examples are, using this theorem, not perfect, since they each contain either a hole or an antihole of size 5.

88
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:14,532
We won’t be proving this theorem, since it took a 150-page paper released in 2002 to do so,

89
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:21,983
but we’ll observe that it immediately proves the Weak perfect graph theorem (from definition of a complement – holes become antiholes and vice versa).
