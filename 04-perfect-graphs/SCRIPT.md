# Introduction
Perfect graphs are a family of graphs that contain many graph families and have various special properties, notably that many algorithms that are NP complete on a general graph can be solved efficiently on a perfect one.

There exists various characterizations of perfect graphs. The one that we'll be focusing on in this video is the weak perfect graph theorem, proved in 1972 by László Lovász.

Before proceeding to the proof, there are some definitions and lemmas we have to know.

# Complement graph
A graph $H$ is a complement of the graph $G$, if and only if each two vertices of $G$ are not adjacent in $H$.

# Clique and independent set
A clique is a subgraph of a graph, such that each two vertices are adjacent.

Analogically, and independent set of a graph is a set of vertices such that no two are adjacent.

TODO: animation on the same graph!

These two concepts are closely tied together. Considering a complement of a graph, we see that each independent set becomes a clique, and each clique an independent set.

This will be important in the proof.

# Induced subgraph
A graph $H$ is an induced subgraph of the graph $G$, if and only if we can get $H$ by removing zero or more vertices from $G$. Note that we're only removing whole vertices (and their edges), not edges by themselves.

# Perfect Graphs
For the most important definition of the video, a graph is perfect if and only if it's chromatic number
