00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:11,050
In this video, we'll be proving Vizing's theorem, which puts an upper and lower bound on the number of colors needed to edge-color a graph.

2
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:18,350
An edge coloring is valid, if no vertex contains edges of the same color. For example, this is a valid edge coloring, while this is not.

3
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,500
For example, this is a valid edge coloring, while this is not.

4
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:34,833
The theorem states that the number of colors chi' needed to edge-color a graph is between the maximum degree of the graph Delta(G) and the maximum degree of the graph plus one.

5
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:44,366
As a reminder, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges containing it, and the maximum degree of the graph is the maximum degree of its vertices.

6
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:52,883
Let's look at an example graph. We can use 3 colors to color its edges, which also happens to be its maximum degree.

7
00:00:52,883 --> 00:01:01,266
However, adding additional two edges like so doesn't change the maximum degree, but increases the number of colors needed by one.

8
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:10,800
Proving the lower bound is simple. Looking at a vertex with degree Delta(G), we obviously need as many colors as the number of its edges.

9
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:16,700
Before proving the upper bound, let's make a quick observation that will be useful during the proof.

10
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:22,516
When we have Delta(G) + 1 colors, each vertex of the graph has at least one free color.

11
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:25,866
By free, we mean that the vertex doesn't have an edge of this color.

12
00:01:26,383 --> 00:01:31,016
This makes sense, because we have one more color than the maximum degree of the graph.

13
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:40,100
Additionally, if an adjacent vertex also has this free color, they can switch the free color and the color of the edge between them, without breaking the coloring.

14
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,566
We'll prove the upper bound constructively.

15
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:51,050
Let's assume that we have some partial coloring of G using Delta(G) + 1 colors, and want to color some edge (x, y).

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,833
From the previous observation, we know that x has some free color. If y has the same free color, then we can color the edge (x, y) using it.

17
00:01:55,833 --> 00:02:00,616
If y has the same free color, then we can color the edge (x, y) using it.

18
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:09,916
If x doesn't have this free color, there must be an edge with this color from x to some other vertex, which also has some free color.

19
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:15,516
This chain can go on a bit, but eventually, one of two things will happen.

20
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:21,450
Case one is that the free color of the last vertex in the chain is the free color of x.

21
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,400
In this case, we'll go back the chain and change colors.

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,866
This frees up the color for x that we needed to color (x, y) and we're done.

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,866
Case two is that the free color of the last vertex is a color of an edge from x that we've seen before.

24
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:42,183
This is unfortunate, since we're now stuck in a loop and can't use the previous trick.

25
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:50,700
In this case, we'll take the longest path from v of alternating free colors of x and u, and switch the colors on this path.

26
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,283
We're doing this to get rid of the loop.

27
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:59,333
However, since this path can end up pretty much anywhere, we'll again have to consider two possibilities.

28
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,950
The first is that the path ends in the vertex right before v, let's call it w.

29
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,050
Notice that by switching, we reduced the problem to case 1, only with blue and red reversed.

30
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:18,766
The second is that the path doesn't end in w.

31
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:26,566
This is even better, since x and w now have the same color and we again reduced the problem to case 1.

32
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:36,633
It's also good to realize that the switch operation doesn't break the coloring, since we would then have a neat, but invalid proof.

33
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:44,233
For vertices other than the first and the last, nothing happens, since they still have edges of the same colors.

34
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:49,433
For x, the free color was red to begin with, so it just turns blue.

35
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:58,383
For the ending vertex, we'll make the observation that either red or blue must have been free, because otherwise the path that we took wasn't the longest.

36
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:08,833
Combining the lower and upper bound, we see that no matter what, we can always color any graph using either Delta(G) or Delta(G) + 1 colors.
