In this video, we'll be proving Vizing's theorem, which puts an upper and lower bound on the number of colors needed to edge-color a graph.

2
0:00:13,416 --> 0:00:18,350
An edge coloring is valid, if no vertex contains edges of the same color. For example, this is a valid edge coloring, while this is not.

3
0:00:18,350 --> 0:00:22,500
For example, this is a valid edge coloring, while this is not.

4
0:00:24,783 --> 0:00:34,833
The theorem states that the number of colors chi' needed to edge-color a graph is between the maximum degree of the graph Delta(G) and the maximum degree of the graph plus one.

5
0:00:35,750 --> 0:00:44,366
As a reminder, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges containing it, and the maximum degree of the graph is the maximum degree of its vertices.

6
0:00:46,216 --> 0:00:52,883
Let's look at an example graph. We can use 3 colors to color its edges, which also happens to be its maximum degree.

7
0:00:52,883 --> 0:01:01,266
However, adding additional two edges like so doesn't change the maximum degree, but increases the number of colors needed by one.

8
0:01:02,483 --> 0:01:10,800
Proving the lower bound is simple. Looking at a vertex with degree Delta(G), we obviously need as many colors as the number of its edges.

9
0:01:12,483 --> 0:01:16,700
Before proving the upper bound, let's make a quick observation that will be useful during the proof.

10
0:01:17,216 --> 0:01:22,516
When we have Delta(G) + 1 colors, each vertex of the graph has at least one free color.

11
0:01:22,516 --> 0:01:25,866
By free, we mean that the vertex doesn't have an edge of this color.

12
0:01:26,383 --> 0:01:31,016
This makes sense, because we have one more color than the maximum degree of the graph.

13
0:01:31,550 --> 0:01:40,100
Additionally, if an adjacent vertex also has this free color, they can switch the free color and the color of the edge between them, without breaking the coloring.

14
0:01:42,166 --> 0:01:44,566
We'll prove the upper bound constructively.

15
0:01:44,566 --> 0:01:51,050
Let's assume that we have some partial coloring of G using Delta(G) + 1 colors, and want to color some edge (x, y).

16
0:01:51,600 --> 0:01:55,833
From the previous observation, we know that x has some free color. If y has the same free color, then we can color the edge (x, y) using it.

17
0:01:55,833 --> 0:02:00,616
If y has the same free color, then we can color the edge (x, y) using it.

18
0:02:01,416 --> 0:02:09,916
If x doesn't have this free color, there must be an edge with this color from x to some other vertex, which also has some free color.

19
0:02:10,616 --> 0:02:15,516
This chain can go on a bit, but eventually, one of two things will happen.

20
0:02:16,133 --> 0:02:21,450
Case one is that the free color of the last vertex in the chain is the free color of x.

21
0:02:21,450 --> 0:02:25,400
In this case, we'll go back the chain and change colors.

22
0:02:25,400 --> 0:02:29,866
This frees up the color for x that we needed to color (x, y) and we're done.

23
0:02:31,200 --> 0:02:37,866
Case two is that the free color of the last vertex is a color of an edge from x that we've seen before.

24
0:02:37,866 --> 0:02:42,183
This is unfortunate, since we're now stuck in a loop and can't use the previous trick.

25
0:02:43,266 --> 0:02:50,700
In this case, we'll take the longest path from v of alternating free colors of x and u, and switch the colors on this path.

26
0:02:50,700 --> 0:02:52,283
We're doing this to get rid of the loop.

27
0:02:53,216 --> 0:02:59,333
However, since this path can end up pretty much anywhere, we'll again have to consider two possibilities.

28
0:03:00,650 --> 0:03:05,950
The first is that the path ends in the vertex right before v, let's call it w.

29
0:03:05,950 --> 0:03:12,050
Notice that by switching, we reduced the problem to case 1, only with blue and red reversed.

30
0:03:15,466 --> 0:03:18,766
The second is that the path doesn't end in w.

31
0:03:19,533 --> 0:03:26,566
This is even better, since x and w now have the same color and we again reduced the problem to case 1.

32
0:03:29,716 --> 0:03:36,633
It's also good to realize that the switch operation doesn't break the coloring, since we would then have a neat, but invalid proof.

33
0:03:37,316 --> 0:03:44,233
For vertices other than the first and the last, nothing happens, since they still have edges of the same colors.

34
0:03:44,233 --> 0:03:49,433
For x, the free color was red to begin with, so it just turns blue.

35
0:03:49,433 --> 0:03:58,383
For the ending vertex, we'll make the observation that either red or blue must have been free, because otherwise the path that we took wasn't the longest.

36
0:03:59,800 --> 0:04:08,833
Combining the lower and upper bound, we see that no matter what, we can always color any graph using either Delta(G) or Delta(G) + 1 colors.
