Here is a really cool way of encoding numbers using dots and parentheses that you might not have seen before.

2
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:06,866
Pause here and see if you can figure it out.

3
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:11,333
First off, the primes follow a pattern,

4
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,450
so it’s a good idea to look at the factorizations.

5
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:17,233
If we look at numbers
with no repeating factors,

6
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:20,016
they only have single nested parentheses or dots,

7
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:21,150
which is just zeros and ones.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,200
Furthermore, numbers with repeating factors are nested more heavily,

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,016
so the encoding likely involves their powers.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,650
If we look at the full factorization, the encoding becomes quite clear –

11
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,000
the powers of the primes correspond
to the inner sequence of dots and brackets.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,500
For example, 5 is 2^0 times 3^0 times 5^1

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,000
and 9 is 2^0 times 3^2 .

14
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:49,000
Thanks for watching!
