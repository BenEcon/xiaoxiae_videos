00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,466
Imagine you’re given n colors and a graph.

2
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:05,200
Your task is to find the number of colorings of vertices

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,783
such that adjacent vertices have different colors –

4
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:08,366
what would you do?

5
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:11,283
You could try to bruteforce the solution,

6
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:12,833
but that would only work for smaller ns.

7
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:17,016
Instead, we can calculate what is called a chromatic polynomial for this graph.

8
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,416
If we plug in n for any x,

9
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,900
we get the exact number of colorings.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,200
Cool, right?

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,783
This, however, is just a special case of the much more interesting Tutte polynomial.

12
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,916
This two-variate polynomial is fascinating because besides colorings,

13
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,550
(x = 1, y = 1) counts the number of spanning trees,

14
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,166
(x = 2, y = 0) counts the number of acyclic orientations

15
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,199
and much more –

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,516
it is used for measuring network reliability,

17
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:41,300
for calculating linear codes

18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,900
and even has ties to quantum field theory.

19
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,333
If you found this interesting and want to know more

20
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,916
(like how to actually calculate it),

21
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,816
I’d recommend you check out this neat handbook,

22
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,466
written by many experts in the field,

23
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:54,516
which contains a great overview of this polynomial’s many fascinating uses.

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,050
In any case, thanks for watching!
