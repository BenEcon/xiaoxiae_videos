00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Would you like to win a Nobel Prize in economics?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,233
Or be able to formulate and solve 
NP-hard problems in an efficient way?

3
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:11,450
Or perhaps transcend the mortal plane and achieve eternal life?

4
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,133
Well in this video, I’ll cover the first two

5
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:17,400
(the third being left as an excercise for the reader),

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,466
since they both utilize the powerful technique of Linear Programming.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,666
To see what it’s all about, let’s start with a simple problem.

8
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:30,400
With the planting season steadily approaching, your farmer friend presents you with the following task.

9
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:34,133
You have 3 tons of potato seeds and 4 tons of carrot seeds.

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,700
To grow the crops efficiently,

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,950
you also have 5 tons of fertilizer,

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,100
which has to be used when planting in a 1:1 ratio

13
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:46,783
(i.e. 1 kilogram of potato or carrot seeds requires 1 kilogram of fertilizer).

14
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:54,300
The profit is 1.2$/kg for potato seeds and 1.7$/kg for carrot seeds.

15
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:58,650
Your goal is to maximize your profit this season –

16
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,700
how much potatoes and carrots should you plant?

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,300
To solve this problem, let’s first formalize it.

18
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:11,200
We’ll start by creating variables x_p and x_c for the amount of potatoes and carrots planted (in Kgs).

19
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:16,716
Both are non-negative real numbers, since planting a negative amount of seeds is difficult,

20
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:18,333
and are bounded by the amount we have.

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,716
Additionally, their sum is bounded by the amount of fertilizer we have,

22
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:27,300
since it has to be used in a 1:1 ratio for both potatoes and carrots.

23
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:35,566
The profit can then be described as 1.2x_p + 1.7x_c and we’ll call it the objective function,

24
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:37,816
since it’s the function we’re trying to maximize.

25
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,766
Now that the problem is formalized, it might be helpful to visualize it.

26
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:48,933
Since we have two variables, it’s probably a good idea to use a plane with one axis for each.

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,433
To display the inequalities, we can notice that they are all linear,

28
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:56,533
which means that they are just a weighted sum of the variables

29
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:01,333
and each one defines a line with valid values on one side (a half-plane, to be exact).

30
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:07,400
To satisfy all of the inequalities, we’re interested in the intersection of these half-planes,

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,666
which is the following region.

32
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:15,800
This is pretty useful, since we now know that any solution to our problem will be contained here,

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,700
but our main task is to maximize the objective function.

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,700
Pause here and see if you can figure out what it means geometrically in terms of this visualization.

35
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:35,166
Since the objective function is also linear, it defines a direction in which its value increases.

36
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:44,733
To solve the problem, all we then have to do is move in this direction and record the last intersection, which is the optimum

37
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:52,466
(in our case, 1000 Kgs of potato seeds and 4000 Kgs of carrot seeds, bringing the total profit to 8000 dollars).

38
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,633
And, surprisingly, that’s all there is to linear programming –

39
00:02:57,633 --> 00:03:04,250
we want to find the value of real variables that are subject to linear inequalities and that maximize a linear function.

40
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:09,800
Now this is a pretty simple example, but a linear program can be much more complex.

41
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:15,266
It can contain any number of inequalities, which complicate the shape of our region,

42
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:22,916
and also any number of variables, which bring us from 2D for 2 variables to 3D for 3 and beyond...

43
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:28,583
so while the general concept stays the same, our simple geometric solution won’t do for larger programs.

44
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,150
The Nobel Prize I mentioned at the beginning off the video

45
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,683
was awarded to Kantorovich and Koopmans in 1975

46
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:40,016
for formulating a number of classical logistics and economics problems in this model,

47
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:42,933
which are again too complicated to be solved geometrically.

48
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:49,316
So instead, let’s look at how to solve a linear program algorithmically using the Simplex method.

49
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:56,433
Similar to the geometric solution, we will again be moving in the direction of the objective function,

50
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:57,816
but we’ll do so in a smarter way.

51
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:03,450
For this, we’ll use the fact that the optimum will be achieved in at least one vertex.

52
00:04:04,383 --> 00:04:07,300
It can sometimes be more, like a whole line,

53
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,116
but some vertex will still achieve it, as we see by doing a full rotation.

54
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:19,666
This means that we can move from vertex to vertex (which is called pivotting),

55
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,033
always picking one that brings us closer to our goal,

56
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:26,733
until we can’t any longer, at which point we know we found the optimum.

57
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,116
But before I tell you how it works, let me tell you a short story.

58
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:36,316
It’s 1939 and a student of mathematics arrives late to a lecture.

59
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,500
He sees two problems on the board and, assuming they are homework, writes them down.

60
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:47,166
They prove to be more challenging than usual, but he perseveres and hands them back a week later,

61
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,066
with an apology that they took him so long.

62
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:55,216
A few weeks go by and the student is surprised by a knock on the door by the professor himself,

63
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,316
who reveals to him that they were two famous unsolved problems in the field of statistics.

64
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,950
You might have heard this story, or a version of it,

65
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,633
since it’s an urban legend in the mathematical world,

66
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:09,566
but what you might not know is that the student was Goerge B. 
Dantzig,

67
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,616
the inventor of the algorithm I just described.

68
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:19,050
I stumbled upon this story about Dantzig and many more when doing research for this video  and it was too good to exclude,

69
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,816
so if there’s something you should to take away,

70
00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:22,950
it’s that George B. Dantzig was a really cool guy.

71
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,466
Getting back to the topic at hand,

72
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:33,333
we’ll first rename the variables to x_1 and x_2 , which is the standard way of naming variables in a linear program.

73
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:39,000
To understand how pivotting works numerically, let’s consider what happens when we’re in a vertex.

74
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:44,800
Taking (0, 0) as an example, we see that two of the inequalities are tight,

75
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,116
which means that the left side is equal to the right side

76
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:50,466
(in this case because both x_1 and x_2 are 0).

77
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:54,733
Now say we want to pivot from this vertex to an adjacent one.

78
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,233
To perform this pivot,

79
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:02,400
we first have to loosen one inequality (which determines the direction we move in)

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,500
and tighten another (which determines how far we go).

81
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,533
This is the crucial idea behind the simplex algorithm –

82
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,116
loosen one and tighten another, until we reach the optimum.

83
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:20,266
In order to calculate which variables to loosen and which to tighten,

84
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:22,716
we’ll slightly modify our program to make the math easier

85
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,450
We’ll introduce new variables for each inequality called slack variables,

86
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,883
which act as the difference between the left and the right side,

87
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:33,400
thus turning the inequalities into equalities.

88
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:39,900
This means that a tight inequality before is the same as a variable being set to zero now.

89
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:45,866
As you see, since s_1 and s_3 are zero, the first and third equalities become tight.

90
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:51,150
Feel free to pause here for a second and make sure that this transformation makes sense to you.

91
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:55,133
Let’s now get to the actual computation.

92
00:06:56,033 --> 00:07:00,616
We again start in (0, 0), which means that the initial tight variables will be x_1 and x_2.

93
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:06,633
The tight variables are usually called non-basic and the loose are called basic,

94
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:10,066
but we’ll stick with tight and loose for now (since that’s what they geometrically mean).

95
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:14,550
Before we start the first pivot, we’ll do two things:

96
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:18,650
first, we’ll hide the positive 
inequalities –

97
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,966
they still apply, mind you, but we don’t need them for the actual computation,

98
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:25,200
so there’s no point in keeping them on the screen.

99
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,533
Second, we’ll further rewrite the equalities

100
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:33,450
such that the left side only contains loose variables with a coefficient of 1.

101
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:40,283
This makes calculating the current solution trivial, since we can just set the tight variables to 0 and look at the constants.

102
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,866
Okay, now we’re finally ready for the pivot.

103
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:49,966
First, we need to loosen a variable to determine which direction to go.

104
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:54,366
There is a number of methods for selecting which to loosen,

105
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:58,050
but we’ll stick with the most commonly used one called called Dantzig’s pivot rule,

106
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,250
after the inventor himself.

107
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:03,033
The rule is very simple –

108
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:07,616
we select the variable with the largest positive coefficient in the objective function

109
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:11,033
(i.e. the one representing the steepest direction towards the optimum).

110
00:08:12,316 --> 00:08:17,033
In our case, this is x_2 , which we loosen and start heading in its direction.

111
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:24,783
Now that we’ve selected the direction to move in, we have to determine how far, which we’ll do by tightening.

112
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:31,650
To see what choices we have, we’ll look at equalities where x_2 appears, which are s_2 and s_3 ,

113
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,083
since these are the loose variables constraining it.

114
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:39,416
We want to make either s_2 or s_3 tight but, as we see,

115
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:45,016
only one of them keeps us in the area of valid solutions... so how can we calculate which one it is?

116
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,466
Well let’s simulate what happens when we move in the selected direction.

117
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,166
We see that x_2 is increasing and its value eventually reaches 4000,

118
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:59,400
which evens out the constant value for the second equality, making s_2 tight.

119
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:05,733
Now if we were to go further, s_2 would have to go negative for the equality to still work,

120
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:08,900
which is not allowed since all variables have to be non-negative!

121
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:14,750
So, in other words, to calculate which variable to tighten,

122
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:20,666
we’re interested in the ratio between x_2 and the constants – the larger it is, the sooner we reach it.

123
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:25,366
And, as we’ve seen, it is indeed s_2 , which we tighten.

124
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:31,933
Note that if it is greater than zero (for example if we had another equality like this one),

125
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:36,716
we wouldn’t want it since increasing x_2 in this case will never zero out the constant

126
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:38,000
(since it’s in opposite direction).

127
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,766
So what we actually want is the largest non-positive ratio.

128
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:51,600
Now that we’ve loosened x_2 and tightened s_2 , we still have to fix the equalities and the objective function –

129
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,833
remember that loose variables belong only on the left side,

130
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,700
which now isn’t the case, as you can see by the highlighted s_2s and x_2s.

131
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,416
Swapping them solves the problem for the second equality,

132
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,350
which we can now use as substitutes for the remaining x_2s.

133
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:12,183
After simplifying, we have successfully completed the pivot

134
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:19,416
As a sanity check, we see that setting the tight variables to zero again determines the vertex we’re in,

135
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,450
with the objective function’s value increasing to 6800.

136
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:29,566
At this point, I highly urge you to pause the video and do the next pivot yourself,

137
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:32,633
since it’s a great way of checking how well you understand the algorithm.

138
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,366
To help you out a bit, here are the steps you need to take:

139
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:41,283
First, loosen a variable using Dantzig’s pivot rule,

140
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:45,833
second, tighten a variable given the largest non-positive ratio

141
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,116
and finally fix the equalities by swapping and substituting.

142
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:59,350
Okay – for the next pivot, we repeat exactly what we did for the first one.

143
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:05,733
We determine the variable to loosen by the largest positive coefficient in the objective function, which is x_1 ,

144
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,766
we look at where x1 appears in the equalities and compare the ratios –

145
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:15,900
the largest non-positive one corresponds to s_3 , which we tighten

146
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:20,266
and finally we fix the equalities and the objective function

147
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,283
such that the loose variables are only on the left side.

148
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,566
And we’re done!

149
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:30,416
We can see this because all of the coefficients of the objective function are now negative

150
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,883
so we can’t improve any further.

151
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:39,766
The optimum is 8000, again achieved by setting x_1 to 1000 and x_2 to 4000,

152
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,833
which is the same as the one from our geometric solution,

153
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,483
which is a good indicator that the algorithm works as intended.

154
00:11:47,383 --> 00:11:52,033
So at this point, we have solved the problem both geometrically and algorithmically,

155
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:54,833
but it would be pretty hard to convince someone else that we did

156
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,450
if we were to just show them the result.

157
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,316
It would be nice if we could prove that the solution we found is truly optimal.

158
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,766
One thing that comes to mind is combining the inequalities

159
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:10,200
in a way that creates an upper bound on the objective function,

160
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,116
because that would show that we literally can not get a better result.

161
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:21,466
As an example, if we multiply the first inequality by 1.2 and the second by 1.7 and we sum them up,

162
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:25,933
we get that the objective function is less than or equal to 10 400,

163
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:29,116
which tells us that the objective function can never be greater than that.

164
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:36,833
Or, let’s say 0.2 times the first plus 0.7 times the second plus the third

165
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,566
gives a better estimate of 8400.

166
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,616
This looks promising so let’s formalize and turn these numbers into variables.

167
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:51,400
They have to be non-negative (otherwise the inequality flips)

168
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,550
and must be set in such a way that the left side is at least the objective function

169
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,683
(since we want to constrain it).

170
00:12:58,383 --> 00:13:03,216
Finally, we want to minimize the right side and... we just created a linear program.

171
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:08,283
This is called the dual linear program and is, in my opinion,

172
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:10,616
perhaps the most beautiful thing about linear programming.

173
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:18,133
The dual bounds our original linear program (which 
we’ll call the primal from now on) and vice versa –

174
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:22,433
solutions to the primal will always 
be less than or equal to the solutions of the dual

175
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:25,066
and this is referred to as the weak duality theorem.

176
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:29,816
Now this is not quite what we had in mind –

177
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:31,583
we actually wanted an equality,

178
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:36,583
because only then would we be able to confirm that the solution we found is truly the optimum.

179
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:42,000
This is referred to as the strong duality theorem and, incredibly,

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,800
if the primal has an optimum, it holds true,

181
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,800
meaning that we can always find the proof that we were looking for.

182
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:51,500
Besides proving optimality,

183
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,700
duality has a number of other interesting uses that are sadly beyond the scope of this video,

184
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,100
but will likely be in the next one.

185
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,000
It’s now safe to say that we’ve thoroughly covered the farmer’s problem,

186
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,316
but it turns out that we were actually pretty lucky.

187
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,433
When formulating the problem, we decided that the variables are real numbers,

188
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,666
since planting a fraction of a Kg makes sense.

189
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,033
However, imagine that the things we wanted to plant were trees –

190
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:23,666
in that case, we would like to restrict the solutions to integers only

191
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,233
(since planting a portion of a tree is difficult).

192
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:32,566
This is referred to as integer linear programming (or ILP for short)

193
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:35,583
and it naturally poses two questions:

194
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,900
is the problem easier or harder than linear programming

195
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,916
and can we still solve it efficiently?

196
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:45,533
Well, to illustrate that it gets a whole lot harder,

197
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:49,200
we’ll formulate the knapsack problem (an infamous NP-hard problem),

198
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,600
as an integer linear program.

199
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:56,633
The task is this: we’re given n items, each having a weight and a price.

200
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,550
Given a backpack with a carry weight (say 17 kg),

201
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,766
our task is to  maximize the price of the items we take

202
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:07,183
without exceeding the carry weight.

203
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,083
For this problem, using binary variables will be very useful.

204
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,933
We can achieve this by creating a variable and adding inequalities

205
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:19,283
such that its value is between 0 and 1.

206
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Since it’s an integer linear program,

207
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,400
the only values the variable can have will therefore be 0 and 1.

208
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:34,066
There will be one binary variable for each item, having value 1 if we take it and 0 if we don’t.

209
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,266
There will only be one additional inequality,

210
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:42,116
which is that the weight of the items we carry doesn’t exceed the backpack’s carry weight.

211
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:47,416
This can be done by multiplying the binary variables with their weights –

212
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:53,333
if the item is not taken, its variable will be 0 and its weight won’t be counted, otherwise it will be.

213
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,950
Similarly, the function to maximize is the price of the items we carry,

214
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,416
again done by multiplying the binary variables with their prices.

215
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:08,916
Alternatively, if we put the variables into a vector,

216
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:12,666
the linear program can be stated like this, which is quite a bit more concise.

217
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,466
And since there’s been enough theory,

218
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:20,333
let’s write some Python code that solves this problem using the pulp package,

219
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:24,700
which is an excellent tool for formulating and solving linear programs of all shapes and sizes.

220
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,900
Taking the data from the example we’ve seen,

221
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:36,333
we’ll formulate the variables, the single inequality, the objective function and finally solve the problem.

222
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:45,866
Printing the output, the optimal price of the items in this case is 84, if we take items 2, 4, 5, and 6.

223
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,133
So while the problem is still NP-hard,

224
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:54,600
there is a significant amount of optimizations that the solver can do,

225
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,233
which makes it run very fast on real-world data

226
00:16:57,233 --> 00:17:00,350
(and likely much faster compared to whatever program you and I can write).

227
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,250
As another pulp example,

228
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,766
this is an implementation of the farmer’s problem that we saw earlier in the video.

229
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:12,650
I have to say that solving the problem we spent the majority of the video on

230
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,116
in 20 lines of code and a fraction of a second feels pretty satisfying.

231
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,450
There are many more examples that can be solved

232
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,566
with both regular and integer linear programming and if you’re interested,

233
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:27,816
I left a link to my website showcasing the interesting ones in the description.

234
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:36,683
So as an introduction to linear programming, I think we’ve covered most of the important topics,

235
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:41,516
that being the simplex method, duality and integer linear programming.

236
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:47,783
However, we’ve covered them rather superficially and there is a great deal of nuance to each of them.

237
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:53,500
For the simplex method, what if (0, 0) isn’t a vertex – how do we start?

238
00:17:54,716 --> 00:17:59,633
Also, the way we described it, the method might run in exponential time

239
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:03,083
and may even get stuck in an infinite loop – can we fix this?

240
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:10,566
For duality, does every linear program have a dual and if so, how do we create it?

241
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,550
And once we do, can we use it in developing fast algorithms for the primal?

242
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:19,883
And, last but not least,

243
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:23,233
are there classes of ILP problems that can be solved in polynomial time?

244
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:29,116
And for those that aren’t in such class, can we at least get approximate solutions in polynomial time?

245
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,266
I like to think that most topics, linear programming included, can be thought of as an iceberg

246
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,633
(in this case a convex one).

247
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,450
The surface contains simple concepts that everyone can see,

248
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,316
but if you dive down, you can discover a whole new world,

249
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:47,066
a part of which we’ll explore in the next video.

250
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,716
So if you found this interesting, stay tuned and thank you for watching!
