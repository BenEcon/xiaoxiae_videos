- Programming Model (convert to Programming (bathroo)model) [code]
- Tile Complexity (convert to tile complexity) [code]

- Ending with zero to be divisible [script + code]
- Parentheses: these two via this short one [code]

- parentheses example time complexity shift down: slower [code]

- not a strong as python: transform matching shapes [code]

- to infinity heading [code]

- all chapters: animation of where we currently are [code]
	- make sure that it is more apparent that we are entering a chapter
